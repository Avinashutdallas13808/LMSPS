Description_LazyData_true: It means data isn't loaded into memory when the package is loaded, but rather only when the user first requests to use that specific dataset. It reduces initial memory usage since data is only loaded when needed, it speeeds up package load time, and it is more efficient for packages that contain multiple datasets where users might only need some of them.
